 What up? We're Blind Channel.
I'm tonight's host, Joonas BC. We got loads of questions from you.
You ask, Blind Channel will answer. What three songs would you
recommend to someone - listening to your music
for the first time? <i>Dark Side.</i> <i>Timebomb.</i>
<i>- Over My Dead Body.</i> It's always my favourite.
- That's all you need to listen to. If you weren't a Violent Pop band,
"Violent Bop band", - what genre would you play? I'd be rapping, doing some trap stuff. I'd probably do smooth jazz.
- Aleksi would be a DJ. Yeah, Aleksi.
- Aleksi would be producing. Have you ever had big fights? If so, what was it about? I can think of one big fight.
